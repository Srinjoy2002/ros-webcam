# Webcam Object Recognition with ROS and OpenCV

## ðŸŒŸ Overview

Welcome to the **Webcam Object Recognition** project! In this endeavor, we've combined the power of **ROS** (Robot Operating System) with **OpenCV** to create a real-time object detection system. The magic happens as your webcam captures video, and our program identifies objects (like faces) in the feed, bringing the results to life in the **RViz** visualization environment. Itâ€™s an exciting way to see computer vision in action!

## ðŸ“‹ Prerequisites

Before diving in, letâ€™s make sure you have everything you need:

- **ROS**: Weâ€™re using ROS Noetic, so make sure it's installed and ready on your machine.
- **OpenCV**: This is essential for processing images, so install it if you havenâ€™t yet.
- **Python 3**: Our scripts run on Python 3, so ensure it's installed.
- **cv_bridge**: This handy package helps convert ROS images to OpenCV format.

## ðŸš€ Installation

Letâ€™s get your workspace set up:

1. **Create Your ROS Workspace**:

   Open a terminal and run:

   ```bash
   mkdir -p ~/ros_webcam_ws/src
   cd ~/ros_webcam_ws/src
   catkin_init_workspace
