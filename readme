# Webcam Object Recognition with ROS and OpenCV

## Overview

Welcome to the Webcam Object Recognition project! In this project, we've combined the power of ROS (Robot Operating System) with OpenCV to create a real-time object detection system. Using your webcam, our program identifies objects (like faces) in the video feed, bringing the results to life in the RViz visualization environment. It’s a practical demonstration of computer vision in action.

## Prerequisites

Before getting started, ensure you have the following:

- **ROS**: We're using ROS Noetic, so make sure it's installed on your machine.
- **OpenCV**: Essential for image processing—install it if you haven’t yet.
- **Python 3**: Our scripts run on Python 3.
- **cv_bridge**: This package helps convert ROS images to OpenCV format.

## Installation

Follow these steps to set up your workspace:

1. **Create Your ROS Workspace**:

   Open a terminal and run:

   ```bash
   mkdir -p ~/ros_webcam_ws/src
   cd ~/ros_webcam_ws/src
   catkin_init_workspace
   ```

2. **Clone the Project Repository**:

   Download this project into your workspace:

   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url> webcam_object_recognition
   ```

   (Replace `<repository-url>` with the link to the project repository.)

3. **Build Your Workspace**:

   Now, let’s build it to get everything ready:

   ```bash
   cd ~/ros_webcam_ws
   catkin_make
   ```

4. **Source Your Workspace**:

   Make sure your terminal recognizes the new packages:

   ```bash
   source devel/setup.bash
   ```

## Usage

Here’s how to run your object recognition system:

1. **Start the Object Recognition Node**:

   Open a terminal and type:

   ```bash
   rosrun webcam_object_recognition webcam_object_recognition.py
   ```

2. **Launch RViz**:

   Open another terminal and run:

   ```bash
   rviz
   ```

3. **Set Up RViz**:

   - **Add an Image Display**: Click on “Add” and select “Image”. Set the topic to `/webcam/image_with_detections`.
   - **Add a Marker Display**: Click “Add” again and choose “Marker”. Set the topic to `/detected_objects`.
   - **Fix the Frame**: Make sure the Fixed Frame is set correctly (e.g., `camera_frame`).

4. **See It in Action**:

   You should now see the webcam feed along with detected faces in RViz. This is your object recognition system at work.

## Code Structure

The main script, `webcam_object_recognition.py`, is in the `scripts` directory. Here’s a quick rundown of what it does:

- **Object Detection**: Uses OpenCV's Haar Cascade classifier to detect faces.
- **Visualization**: Detected objects are published as markers in RViz, and the webcam feed is displayed.

## Dependencies

Ensure the following dependencies are installed:

- `sensor_msgs`
- `cv_bridge`
- `visualization_msgs`
- `opencv-python`

To install OpenCV, you can use pip:

```bash
pip install opencv-python
```

## Troubleshooting

If you run into issues, try the following:

- If your webcam doesn’t open, confirm that it’s functioning properly.
- If RViz isn’t displaying the markers or images, check that the topics are set up correctly and that you’ve sourced your ROS environment.
