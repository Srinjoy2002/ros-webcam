# Webcam Object Recognition with ROS and OpenCV

## 🌟 Overview

Welcome to the Webcam Object Recognition project! In this endeavor, we've combined the power of ROS (Robot Operating System) with OpenCV to create a real-time object detection system. The magic happens as your webcam captures video, and our program identifies objects (like faces) in the feed, bringing the results to life in the RViz visualization environment. It’s an exciting way to see computer vision in action!

## 📋 Prerequisites

Before diving in, let’s make sure you have everything you need:

- **ROS**: We’re using ROS Noetic, so make sure it's installed and ready on your machine.
- **OpenCV**: This is essential for processing images, so install it if you haven’t yet.
- **Python 3**: Our scripts run on Python 3, so ensure it's installed.
- **cv_bridge**: This handy package helps convert ROS images to OpenCV format.

## 🚀 Installation

Let’s get your workspace set up:

1. **Create Your ROS Workspace**:

   Open a terminal and run:

   ```bash
   mkdir -p ~/ros_webcam_ws/src
   cd ~/ros_webcam_ws/src
   catkin_init_workspace
   ```

2. **Clone the Project Repository**:

   Download this project into your workspace:

   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url> webcam_object_recognition
   ```

   (Replace `<repository-url>` with the link to the project repository.)

3. **Build Your Workspace**:

   Now, let’s build it to get everything ready:

   ```bash
   cd ~/ros_webcam_ws
   catkin_make
   ```

4. **Source Your Workspace**:

   Make sure your terminal recognizes the new packages:

   ```bash
   source devel/setup.bash
   ```

## 🎉 Usage

Now for the fun part! Here’s how to run your object recognition system:

1. **Start the Object Recognition Node**:

   Open a terminal and type:

   ```bash
   rosrun webcam_object_recognition webcam_object_recognition.py
   ```

2. **Launch RViz**:

   Open another terminal and run:

   ```bash
   rviz
   ```

3. **Set Up RViz**:

   - **Add an Image Display**: Click on “Add” and select “Image”. Set the topic to `/webcam/image_with_detections`.
   - **Add a Marker Display**: Click “Add” again and choose “Marker”. Set the topic to `/detected_objects`.
   - **Fix the Frame**: Make sure the Fixed Frame is set correctly (e.g., `camera_frame`).

4. **See It in Action**:

   You should now see the webcam feed along with detected faces in RViz. Enjoy the sight of your object recognition system at work!

## 🔍 Code Structure

The heart of this project lies in the `webcam_object_recognition.py` script found in the `scripts` directory. Here’s a quick rundown of what it does:

- **Object Detection**: We use OpenCV's Haar Cascade classifier to spot faces.
- **Visualization**: Detected objects are published as markers in RViz, and the webcam feed is displayed.

## 📦 Dependencies

To ensure everything runs smoothly, make sure you have the following:

- `sensor_msgs`
- `cv_bridge`
- `visualization_msgs`
- `opencv-python`

If you need to install OpenCV, you can easily do so with pip:

```bash
pip install opencv-python
```

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

If you run into any bumps along the way, here are a few tips:

- If your webcam doesn’t open, double-check that it’s working properly.
- If RViz isn’t displaying the markers or images, verify that the topics are set up correctly and that you’ve sourced your ROS environment.
